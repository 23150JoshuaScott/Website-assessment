            <h1>What cube should you use</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="p-text">For speed cubing, it’s best to use a high-quality, modern cube designed specifically for fast and smooth turning. These cubes typically have features like adjustable tension, corner-cutting (allowing layers to turn even if the cube isn’t perfectly aligned), and smooth, lightweight mechanisms. Popular brands among speed cubers include Gan, MoYu, and QiYi, which offer cubes made with durable plastic and advanced designs to reduce friction and locking. Many cubers also customize their cubes with lubrication and tension adjustments to suit their personal turning style and improve their solving speed. Avoid traditional or cheaply made cubes, as they tend to be slower and less reliable during fast solves.</p>

            <p class="p-info">The classic Rubik’s brand cube is the original puzzle that started it all, but it’s generally not the best choice for speed cubing. While it’s durable and great for beginners, it tends to have stiffer turns and less smooth mechanics compared to modern speed cubes. However, Rubik’s has released updated versions with improved designs to better compete with other brands in the speed cubing community.</p>

            <h1>Why its important to have a good cube</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="p-text">It’s important for beginners to buy a speed cube that meets their needs because the right cube can make learning faster and more enjoyable. A cube that’s too stiff or hard to turn can be frustrating and discourage practice, while a cube that’s smooth and easy to handle helps build confidence and improves solving speed. Beginners also benefit from cubes with adjustable tension and good corner-cutting, which allow them to customize the cube as their skills grow. Choosing a cube that fits their style and comfort level encourages consistent practice, making the learning process smoother and more rewarding.</p>
